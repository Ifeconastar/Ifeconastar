### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  ðŸ‘€ I am a software engineer who is currently learning the trade at ALXAfrica. I am interested in solving problems through writing codes and designing software. I know that new problems are nothing but the possibilities of learning something new. I also know that facing many technical problems can broaden my technical knowledge and make me a better engineer.

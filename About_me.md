- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ifeconastar
- 👀 I am a software engineer who is currently learning the trade at ALXAfrica 
I am interested in solving problems through writing codes and designing software. 
I know that new problems are nothing but the possibilities of learning something new.
 I also know that facing many technical problems can broaden my technical knowledge and make me a better engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
